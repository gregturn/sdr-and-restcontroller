This app reproduces a problem when mixing Spring Data REST with an app using @RestController.

When *spring-data-rest* is commented out of `build.gradle`, this is the observed behavior:

----
$ ./gradlew bootRun
...
<app starts up>
----

In another shell, do this:

----
$ curl -i localhost:8080/hobbit/Frodo
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Fri, 18 Jul 2014 18:36:49 GMT

{"id":2,"firstName":"Frodo","lastName":"Baggins"}
----

* The content-type is *application/json*
* The JSON it self isn't formatted but instead compressed.
* The *id* attribute is printed out

Uncomment *spring-data-rest* and re-run the app, and this is what's observed:

----
$ curl -i localhost:8080/hobbit/Frodo
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Content-Type: application/hal+json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Fri, 18 Jul 2014 18:36:18 GMT

{
  "firstName" : "Frodo",
  "lastName" : "Baggins"
}
----

* The content-type changes to *application/hal+json*
* The JSON is getting pretty-printed.
* The *id* attribute is suppressed.

This appears to show that Spring Data REST's serialization is kicking in, even though the controller being exercised isn't part of SDR's setup.
